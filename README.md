# projPY
I am learning python project since April 2022.<br>
I have used the codes I have learnt in this project.<br>
Anyone can review my works and comment on it. <br>
I am expecting some challenges to solve so that I could learn more from doing it. <br>
I am new to github as well. Guys please help me learn github and python.<br>
<br>Thank you.
